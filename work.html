    <h4>Volunteering in School</h4>
    <!--Natasha Campanaro Volunteer-->
    <p>I started to volunteer at Sutherland Elementary School when I was in middle school and continued throughout high school. There I volunteered for hundreds of hours in classrooms, in the library, at field days, during summer school, with after school care, and in the front office. I love learning and love sharing my love of learning. Below is a video of me working with a student on an art project which involved paper airplanes.</p>

    <h4>Summer Camp Counselor</h4>
    <!--Natasha Campanaro Work-->
    <p>Within Tae Kwon Do, I was a camp counselor for Dunedin Tae Kwon Do's summer camp program. The camp was a daily camp where Tae Kwon Do students got to practice the art, learn the disciplines, go on daily field trips, make friends, and create memories. I was an assistant counselor for four years before becoming a head counselor for two years.</p>
   
    <h4>Nanny</h4>
    <!--Natasha Campanaro Work-->
    <p>My junior year of high school, I was granted the oppurtunity to nanny for a local family in my community. The family had three kids, when I first started two of the children were five and the third was three months old. I was their nanny for two years, until I had to go away to college. I am pictured above with the youngest when she was about two years old. </p>
    
    <h4>Cashier/Hostess</h4>
    <!--Natasha Campanaro Work-->
    <p>The summer before leaving Palm Harbor to go to Florida Gulf Coast University, I accepted the job as a Cashier at Fairway Pizza and Sports Page Pub. At Fairway, my position was a Cashier but I would pick up Hostess shifts frequently to help out.</p>
