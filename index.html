    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Natasha Campanaro and I am a student at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am from a beach community in west- central Florida. I love learning new things, being outside in the sunshine, and spending time with family and friends. A few fun facts about me is that I am an outgoing person, my favorite animal is an elephant, and I am an only child. </p>
        <p>For fun, I attached an audio clip of an elephant trumpeting!</p>
