        <p>I have always had a love of learning. Where others dreaded the walk to school, I was always running ahead, excited to get there.</p>
        <p>Raised in Palm Harbor, I went to school in the Palm Harbor community. I attended Sutherland Elementary School for Kindergarden through fifth grade. In elementary school I was in the gifted program and served on student government. For sixth through eighth grade I went to Palm Harbor Middle School. During my three years there, I was in Math Club, Drama Club, and National Junior Honors Society. </p>
        <p>I was a proud Hurricane at Palm Harbor University High School from nineth to twelfth grade. As a Hurricane, I was a member of National Honors Society, Student Government, National Art Honors Society, Future Business Leaders of America, and Key Club. Senior year, I served as Student Government Executive Board Treasurer. Additionally, I was a student in the Center of Academics and Business Administration (CABAM) and competed in a state-wide competition with a business plan I composed. During my senior year, I was accepted into the duel-enrollment program with the local community college, Saint Petersburg College, and was able to complete Composition One and Two while still in high school.</p>
        <p>The picture above was from my graduation from Palm Harbor University High School in May 2017. I am pictured with my group of friends who I graduated with.</p>
