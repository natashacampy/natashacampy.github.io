    <p>During my senior year of high school, I applied to three schools and was accepted into all of them. After careful consideration, I committed to Florida Gulf Coast University. </p>
    <p>I started at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fall of 2017 and declared my major as Mathematics. My expected graduation date is Spring of 2021.</p>
    
    <p>During my first year at Florida Gulf Coast University I made Dean's List. I was elected Treasurer of my resident hall's Area Council. Through this position I work with a team to create programs and events to build the community within the resident hall. I also joined math club and was initiated into the sorority Alpha Chi Omega. I was accpeted into National Honors Society. I was also awarded the amazing oppurtunity to attend Alternative Spring Break. Alternative Spring Break is a program where you give up your spring break to go and volunteer over fourty hours of community service in an in-need community. For my trip we went to New York to do service.</p>
