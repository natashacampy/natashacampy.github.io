    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <!--Natasha Campanaro Childhood-->
        <p>I was born and raised in Palm Harbor, Florida. Palm Harbor is a town in west-central Florida, near Clearwater and Tampa. I am an only child and am very close with my parents as well as my extended family. In Kindergarten, I started Tae Kwon Do at Dunedin Tae Kwon Do Academy in Dunedin, Florida. In Kindergarten, I also joined a Girl Scout Troup with the Girl Scouts of West Central Florida. To learn more about my childhood, please follow the link below.</p> 
        <p>After starting Tae Kwon Do in Kindergarden, I continued to practice it until I graduated high school. Dunedin Tae Kwon Do focused on the five disciplines: courtesy, integrety, perseverance, self-control, and courage. During this time I reached the rank of third-degree black belt and became a certified intructor. As an instructor I taught students as young as four to as old as seventy. Additionally, at Dunedin Tae Kwon Do's summmer camp, I was an assistant councilor for four years before becoming a head councilor for two years.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned, in Kindergaden I also joined the Girl Scouts of West Central Florida as a Daisy. I was a Girl Scout for ten years. During that time my troop and I participated in hundreds of hours of community service and even received the Bronze Award for a service project we completed.</p>
